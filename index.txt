# **Mechatronics Engineering Student at McMaster University**

<!---Below is the main paragraph--->
As an individual, I always love inventing new ideas, designs, and technologies that do not already exist. On top of that, I am very passionate about robotics and working toward artificial intelligence. I am always very motivated about engineering because I can see how my individual hard work and creative ideas work towards a satisfied customer. I spend most of my free time learning about certain mechanisms in different engineering fields and constantly brainstorm how to combine those ideas or improve them. 

As a Mechatronics Engineering & COOP student at McMaster University, I have gained a lot of knowledge about Electrical, Mechanical, and Computer Engineering. This opportunity has allowed me to further expand my understanding of many physical and mathematical concepts that form the fundamental ground for any engineering project. Most importantly, I have learned how to manage stress, do more than I can handle, work smart not hard, and create a happy environment around you while going through all of the above.
