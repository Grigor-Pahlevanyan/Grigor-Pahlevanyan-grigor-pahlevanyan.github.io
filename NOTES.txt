I have modified the index.html file

In case if anything goes wrong, you can copy paste the code below, and replace the old index.html. 

---
layout: home
# Index page
---

Why did I do this? 
Everytime that you would make a change, it would automatically re-create the index.html file in the "_site" which is what is actuallt being hosted. So by removing the code above and 
manually creating the index.html it no longer has the ability to re-create the file. 

Why do I even wanted to have a custom index.html?
I don't like the original "home" page and I think that it needs to be called "Experience" instead and be at the very bottom of the side bar. The only way to do this is by forcefully modifing
the index.html file. Luckly however, all the other tabs are not like the "home" tab and so you can modify them much easier.

Note, you may need to update the index.html everytime you make an update.
