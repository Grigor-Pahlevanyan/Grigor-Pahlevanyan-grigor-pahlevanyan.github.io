I have modified the index.html file

In case if anything goes wrong, you can copy paste the code below, and replace the old index.html. 

---
layout: home
# Index page
---

Why did I do this? 
Everytime that you would make a change, it would automatically re-create the index.html file in the "_site" which is what is actuallt being hosted. So by removing the code above and 
manually creating the index.html it no longer has the ability to re-create the file. 

Why do I even wanted to have a custom index.html?
I don't like the original "home" page and I think that it needs to be called "Experience" instead and be at the very bottom of the side bar. The only way to do this is by forcefully modifing
the index.html file. Luckly however, all the other tabs are not like the "home" tab and so you can modify them much easier.

Note, you may need to update the index.html everytime you make an update.

# **Mechatronics Engineering Student at McMaster University**

<!---Below is the main paragraph--->
As an individual, I always love inventing new ideas, designs, and technologies that do not already exist. On top of that, I am very passionate about robotics and working toward artificial intelligence. I am always very motivated about engineering because I can see how my individual hard work and creative ideas work towards a satisfied customer. I spend most of my free time learning about certain mechanisms in different engineering fields and constantly brainstorm how to combine those ideas or improve them. 

As a Mechatronics Engineering & COOP student at McMaster University, I have gained a lot of knowledge about Electrical, Mechanical, and Computer Engineering. This opportunity has allowed me to further expand my understanding of many physical and mathematical concepts that form the fundamental ground for any engineering project. Most importantly, I have learned how to manage stress, do more than I can handle, work smart not hard, and create a happy environment around you while going through all of the above.
