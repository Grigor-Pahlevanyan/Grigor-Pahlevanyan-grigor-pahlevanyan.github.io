## Background Info
Most deadly car accidents can be prevented if the vehicle engaged in an accident absorbs some of the forces that are acting on its passengers at the moment of collision. That is why all cars nowadays have areas known as "crumple" zones. These areas are meant to "crumple" when an accident occurs. Crumple zones transfer the forces from the collision to bending and twisting the parts of the car (i.e. engine, hood, bumper... etc.). This process increases the time at which the change in velocity of the vehicle occurs (comes to a complete stop). The faster it comes to a stop, the more force will be applied instantaneously and the fewer chances the passengers have for survival.

My personal project is a car seat which is not fixed to the ground of the vehicle. Instead it is connected to a rail which is mechanically supported by springs which will engage during an accident. During a sudden stop there is a lot of inertia from the passengers, the seat will provide the passengers with more time to change their velocity from 60 km/hr to 0 km/hr. This means the impulse of the collision experienced by the passengers will be less. instead of having 1 second to absorb the impact, the passenger will have 2 seconds which is double the time and half the impact per second of the original accident.

This project is very challenging as it continuosly forces me to learn a lot of mechanical, electrical and embedded systems concepts. As you can see, I am extremely passionate about all kinds of engineering streams and really like working on such multi-discplinary projects. Below I have included more in-depth documentations. 

# Mechanical Work

## Axle Shaft to Seat Connector
This mechanical component is responsible for making a connection between the moving shaft and the seat.

## Motor Mount
This is the Nema 23 Motor Mount which connects the stepper motor to the Axle Shaft.
