## A Bit of History
Injuries in most fatal accidents can be prevented if the vehicles engaged in the collision absorbs some of the forces that act on its passengers during th impact. That is why all cars nowadays have areas known as "crumple" zones. These areas are meant to "crumple" when an accident occurs. Crumple zones transfer the forces from the collision to bending and twisting mechanical parts (i.e. engine, hood, bumper... etc.). This process increases the time at which the change in velocity of the vehicle occurs (comes to a complete stop). The faster it comes to a stop, the more force will be applied instantaneously and the fewer chances the passengers have for survival. My project has taken inspiration from this idea and extended it to the seats.

## Brief Description
I have made a car seat that can absorb a portion of the impact during a collision and save drivers and passengers from fatal accidents. The seat is not fixed to the ground, instead, it is connected to a rail that is mechanically supported by springs that engage during an accident. During a sudden stop, the driver will experience a big impulse due to their inertia, the smart safety seat will provide the passengers with more time to stop their forward moving velocity. This means the impulse of the collision experienced by the passengers will be less. instead of having 1 second to absorb the impact, the passenger will have 2 seconds which is double the time and half the impact per second of the original accident.
