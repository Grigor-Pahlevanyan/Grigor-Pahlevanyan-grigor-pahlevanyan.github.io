# Electrical Lead

- Developed a new "Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS)" PCB and a precharge PCB from the ground up with my small team.

- Learned about Maximum Power Point Tracker and Battery Management Systems.

## Power Control Systems Member
- Working with various programs such as MPLAB, NI Multisim, Eagle and many more to create a power management system. The power management system is responsible for distributing the power to other boards across the car, based on the received CAN Bus signals.
